# Ansible-DevSecOps-Petshop-project-Jenkins-CI-CD
We will be deploying a Petshop Java-based application. This is an everyday use case scenario used by several organizations. We will be using Jenkins as a CI/CD tool and deploying our application on a Docker container

# Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete DevSecOps CI/CD pipeline for a Java-based Petshop application.
The pipeline integrates Jenkins, SonarQube, OWASP Dependency Check, Trivy, Ansible, and Docker to automate build, test, analysis, security scanning, and deployment.
